Use the ”groceries.csv” dataset and answer the following:

1. How many transactions and items are there in the data set?

2. Prepare the data for finding association rules. Each transaction will contain a list of item in the 
   transaction.
   [['citrus fruit', 'semi-finished bread', 'margarine', 'ready soups'],
   ['tropical fruit', 'yogurt', 'coffee'],…….
   ['whole milk']]

3. Use Python library mlxtend and convert the transactions into a format that can be used in the 
   Apriori method for finding frequent itemsets. 
   pip install mlxtend
   from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder
   from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

4. Find top selling items with minimum support of 2%.

5. Find all frequent itemsets with minimum support of 5%.

6. Find all frequent itemsets of length 2 with minimum support of 2%.

7. Find the top 10 association rules with minimum support of 2%, sorted by confidence in 
   descending order.

8. Find association rules with minimum support of 2% and lift of more than 1.0.
